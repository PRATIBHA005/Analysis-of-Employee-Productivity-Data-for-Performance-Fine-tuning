# Project Overview

## Project Title: 
*Analysis of Employee Productivity Data for Performance Fine tuning*

## Project Description:
*This comprehensive project aims to meticulously analyze and optimize employee productivity by leveraging data transformation and querying techniques on two fundamental tables: productivity and employees. The scope of the analysis encompasses various facets, including string manipulation, column renaming, data type transformations, and productivity metrics evaluation. The objective is to derive actionable insights that can significantly enhance employee performance and overall organizational efficiency.*

## Objectives:
*To transform and analyze employee productivity data for performance enhancement.
To identify key productivity metrics and evaluate employee performance comprehensively.
To optimize productivity by recognizing top performers and areas needing improvement.*

## Key Tasks and Methodologies:

### 1.String Manipulation or Transformation:
*Objective: Ensure data consistency and accuracy by modifying or reformatting strings within the data.
<br>Methodology: Use functions to clean, split, concatenate, or replace strings to standardize data entries.*

### 2.Renaming Column Names:
*Objective: Update column headers to more meaningful or standardized names for better readability and understanding.
<br>Methodology: Implement SQL ALTER TABLE statements or equivalent functions in data manipulation tools to rename columns accurately.*

### 3.Changing Date Time to Date:
*Objective: Simplify date-time entries to simple date formats to facilitate easier analysis.
<br>Methodology: Apply date formatting functions to convert complex date-time entries into a standard date format, ensuring uniformity across the dataset.*

### 4.Creating a New Column for Team Average:
*Objective: Introduce a new column, team_average, to track the average productivity per use case each day.
<br>Methodology: Calculate the daily average productivity per use case using aggregate functions and store the results in a newly created column.*

### 5.Finding the Top Performer for Each Use Case in May:
*Objective: Identify the highest-performing employee for each use case during the month of May.
<br>Methodology: Filter the data for May, group by use cases, and use sorting or ranking functions to pinpoint top performers.*

### 6.Evaluating Managerial Performance in Postcursor_Audits_L1:
*Objective: Assess the productivity of managers in handling Postcursor_Audits_L1 cases.
<br>Methodology: Analyze the performance metrics of managers by aggregating data specific to Postcursor_Audits_L1 cases and comparing results.*

### 7.Identifying Top Performers for Each Manager:
*Objective: Determine the top two performers under each manager based on productivity metrics.
<br>Methodology: Group data by managers, calculate individual performance metrics, and identify top performers using ranking functions.*

### 8.Identifying Employees Performing Below Team Average:
*Objective: Recognize employees whose performance is below the team average for their respective tasks.
<br>Methodology: Compare individual performance metrics with the team average and flag those falling below the threshold.*

### 9.Analyzing Weekly Variations in Employee Productivity:
*Objective: Examine the fluctuations in employee productivity on a week-to-week basis.
Methodology: Aggregate productivity data by week and analyze trends, variations, and patterns to gain insights into productivity dynamics.*

## Key Questions for Employee Productivity Analysis:

### 1.How can we create a new column, team_average, to track the average productivity per use case each day?
*Implement a calculation that aggregates daily productivity metrics for each use case and divides by the number of employees to derive the average. Store this value in a new column for ongoing tracking and analysis.*

### 2.Which employees emerged as the top performers for each use case during the month of May?
*By filtering data for May, grouping by use cases, and sorting performance metrics, we can identify and list the top-performing employees for each use case, providing a clear view of exceptional contributors.*

### 3.Among the managers, who leads the most productive team in handling Postcursor_Audits_L1 cases?
*By evaluating the aggregate performance of teams managed under Postcursor_Audits_L1 cases, we can determine which manager's team exhibits the highest productivity, highlighting effective leadership and management practices.*

### 4.Who are the top two performers under each manager according to productivity metrics?
*By grouping employees under each manager, calculating their productivity metrics, and ranking them, we can identify the top two performers, showcasing the most efficient and impactful team members.*

### 5.Which employees are performing below the team average in their respective tasks?
*By comparing individual performance metrics with the calculated team average, we can identify employees whose productivity falls below the average, signaling areas for potential improvement and support.*

### 6.What insights can be derived from the week-to-week variations in employee productivity?
*Analyzing weekly productivity data can reveal trends, patterns, and anomalies, providing insights into factors influencing productivity, such as workload, project timelines, and employee well-being, enabling more informed decision-making.*

## Conclusion:
*This project provides a detailed, structured approach to analyzing and optimizing employee productivity, leveraging data transformation and querying techniques. By addressing key tasks and answering pivotal questions, the project aims to deliver actionable insights that enhance employee performance and organizational efficiency. This comprehensive analysis will serve as a valuable asset for management in decision-making processes and strategic planning.*
